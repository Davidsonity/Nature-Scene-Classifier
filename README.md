### INTRODUCTION
#### Objectives
The objective of this project is to build powerful Deep Learning Neural network that can classify these images with more accuracy.
In this project we made use of transfer learning. The three models were used 
- Xception
- InceptionV3
- VGG16

#### About Dataset
This is an image data of Natural Scenes around the world.

This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. 
- buildings, 
- forest
- glacier
- mountain
- sea
- street

The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in test and 7k in Prediction. This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification

> For this project the test dataset was used as validation data. New set of data with different shapes were download and the model made very good results on the data.
